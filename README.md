# Sagebrush_Biodiversity_Data
Data from an ecological field sampling and modelling effort. These data were used in the analyses presented in a manuscript published in the Journal of Vegetation Science titled "Soil water availability shapes species richness in mid-latitude shrub steppe plant communities". Metadata is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Data will be archived with EML in the EDI repository later in 2020.
